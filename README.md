# FLASHCARD FINAL PROJECT

#### Video demo: https://youtu.be/rCyA8RC8rK4

#### Description: 

A simple React app styled with Bootstrap that displays a set of card stacks, each containing a set of cards. Each card has a front and a back, and the app tracks the state of which card and which side are being viewed. Editing of the content of each card as well as the title and description of each deck are supported, as is deleting. There is also a study mode where the cards can be gone through in sequence until the stack is complete, where the option is given to the user to restart or to go back to the home screen.

Initially, the data was available through JSON objects, though I wanted to build out a fully-fledged backend. However, after starting this phase of the project, my toddler daughter came down with a significant illness so I am submitting the functioning but incomplete working version of this before the year end deadline. I will perhaps flesh this out more when I'm not so close to the deadline. As it stands, the JSON "server" resets occasionally and the data will reset. I have data in a PostgreSQL database connected to an Express.js backend that I am currently trying to get to work with the React frontend which was built with the JSON data in mind. It's possible implementation will be relatively straightforward, but I have no idea how long she's going to be sick.

Even though I didn't use Python and Flask for this, JavaScript and React have been very valuable tools to learn about in the coding bootcamp from which I am nearing graduation. And the functionality that Jinja affords of being able to accomplish logical operations in webpages is automatic in JavaScript. In addition, React has been very interesting to use in learning how to track and maintain state, and I can see this will be indispensible for creating and maintaining maximally interactive web apps.

Thanks for what you do, CS50!
