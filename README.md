# FLASHCARD FINAL PROJECT

#### Video demo: https://youtu.be/rCyA8RC8rK4

#### Description: 

A simple React app styled with Bootstrap that displays a set of card stacks, each containing a set of cards. Each card has a front and a back, and the app tracks the state of which card and which side are being viewed. Editing of the content of each card as well as the title and description of each deck are supported, as is deleting. There is also a study mode where the cards can be gone through in sequence until the stack is complete, where the option is given to the user to restart or to go back to the home screen.

Initially, the data was given through JSON, though I wanted to build out a fully-fledged backend. However, after starting this phase of the project, my toddler daughter came down with a significant illness so I am submitting the functioning but incomplete working version of this before the year end deadline. I will perhaps flesh this out more when I'm not so close to the deadline. Thanks for what you do, CS50!
